# 1-4: You're Not Really Alone

We've been talking all this time about _self_-directed learning. Sure enough, you are the sole captain navigating your learning journey, but that doesn't mean yours is the only boat in the waterway. Even when learning "on your own," sharing your experience with others isn't just helpful—it's essential. 

## Learning Communities

Even for the most introverted souls—and believe me, I'm among them—learning is a social act. Our minds have evolved to tell stories (we'll be coming back to this a few times), and it is in the telling and retelling of stories that memory is reinforced. We don't need a campfire, but we do need to gather and share. 

**Learning communities** are intentional groups dedicated to study. They share knowledge, experiences, and discuss ideas around their topics of interest. In the sharing, everyone's knowledge both broadens and deepens.

Now, if you're anything like me, this part of the process is the most daunting. I tend to be very self-conscious when learning new things, and prefer not to engage with others for fear that I'll expose my ignorance. But I know that is my insecurity talking, not a rational response. Let's remember our first tenet: you can't learn if you don't feel safe. That absolutely extends to learning communities. It is crucial to find a community in which you feel _safe_ to ask questions. Such a community will be supportive and welcoming of new learners, happy to point beginners in the right direction.

Learning communities come in many forms. It could be a club at school, a local interest group, or even an online forum. The medium is less important than the engagement and connection. I strongly encourage you to find your community, and begin to listen in to the rich conversations taking place there. Then, when you're ready, contribute questions and answers as you can, but most importantly, share your learning journey. Telling others about what you've learned cements the learning in your own mind, and reinforces it for others.

And of course, you're very welcome in TTI's own [Learning Community](https://discord.gg/taggartinstitute)!
