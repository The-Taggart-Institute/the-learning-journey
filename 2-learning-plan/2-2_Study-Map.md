# 2-2: The Study Map

We've arrived at the entire reason why I had you install Obsidian in the first place. Although you certainly don't have to use the tools available here to make your Study Map, I think between all the options, you'll find something that works for you. 
## Purpose

Study Maps provide two purposes: a loose structure to guide your learning objectives, and a way of marking progress and recording discoveries along the way. The specific form is less important than the practice. 
## Structure

The Study Map comprises several elements. You can use some or all of them, but each has value in guiding your journey.
### Target Area

The most important elements of your Study Map, however you make it, are the target areas. These are broad topics of study you wish to pursue. You want a target area to be broad enough to encompass many skills and concepts, but not so broad that it doesn't provide direction. For example, "Python Programming" is a good target area, but "Learning to Code," not so much. Even school subjects are too big. "Math" is a terrible target area, but "Calculus" works well.
### Learning Objectives

For each target area, you need to have clearly-articulated learning objectives. What are the skills and concepts you wish to master during your study? I like to split these up, because they fall nicely into two questions?

1. What do I want to be able to do?
2. What do I want to be able to understand and explain?

While related, these are different results—especially when pursuing target areas with specialized skills. One can become quite proficient at knife techniques without grasping fundamental concepts in cooking, although both would be reasonable learning objectives for someone learning to cook. Or, closer to home for me, you can perfectly explain the theory behind power generation in boxing, but still have terrible form when throwing a punch.
### Existing Strengths

You aren't starting from scratch when beginning your course of study. You likely already have somewhat-related knowledge and/or skills that will help you along the way. Your Study Map should list these in some way to form a foundation for creating connections between skills and concepts, and to remind you that, actually, you *do* have what it takes to succeed.
### Resources

For each target area, list what materials you'll need for your study. This could be space, time, notebooks, software—whatever it is you need on hand so you can get to work when you have the time.
### Evidence

What will be your proof to yourself that you have accomplished your learning goal? This **exhibition of mastery** tends to take the form of a large project that involves most, if not all, of the skills and concepts listed in your learning objectives.
### Schedule

Arguably the most important component besides the target areas. This is where you hold yourself accountable by committing time to your study. How many hours per week? When will you study? Use this space to commit to this time investment.

Now, let's see how we can use Obsidian to make our Study Map.
