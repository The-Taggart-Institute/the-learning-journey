# 3-3: Gamification

For a long long time, I had a problem. I was at the whim of a green owl who demanded that I practice French every day. _Or else_. 

That's right. My name is Michael Taggart, and I am a recovering Duo addict. Maybe you're still in the thrall of the green bird, or maybe you're with me in recovery. If you've used Duolingo, you know that the **streak** is a powerful motivator. But for what, exactly? 

With Duolingo, you do indeed progress by getting language questions correct. And in the big picture, you are learning at least _some_ of a language. But is that really what keeps you logging in? Or is it that streak?

Gamification hijacks the reward centers of our brain to encourage certain behaviors. In fact, this entire mode of teaching is known as **behaviorism**, and its roots are ancient. Punish undesirable behavior, reward positive behavior. As simple as Pavlov's dogs. Is it effective? You've experienced that it is, but there are two significant limits. First, behaviorism can't take you beyond the the lowest levels of Bloom's Taxonomy. You can't punish or reward your way to understanding, analyzing, or creating. Rote memorization is really where it does its best, which is why it is effective at language _vocabulary_.

> 	Side note: the limits of behaviorism and rote memorization were critical to John Dewey's proposed changes to instruction in [_Experience and Education_](https://archive.org/details/ExperienceAndEducation). This text became the foundation for the experiential education movement.

You need to beware of gamification in instructional materials. It is seductive because these resources _feel_ like learning, but after a while, you're simply treading water. No real ascent on the Taxonomy is occurring. Put another way, you're not learning for learning's sake; you're playing the game. 

## Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation

A streak in a game, or a position in a leaderboard, or some other reward furnished by the learning game is an **extrinsic motivation** to keep learning (and we're using "learning" very broadly here). It comes from outside you. Extrinsic motivators are powerful, but short-lived. You'll have to keep seeking them in order to maintain the desired behavior. This is why gamification in learning materials is insidious. Ultimately, it has to be about the game, not the learning.

**Intrinsic motivation** is _your reason_ for setting out on the learning journey. It's your "why." There can be many—short-term, long-term, overlapping—and they can change over time. What matters is that the drive is yours, regardless of the material. Not only will intrinsic motivation sustainably drive you to your goal, it allows you to recognize when gamified learning materials have outlived their purpose for you, and be willing to move on without fear of losing the game.

Remember when we put a "Rationale" section in the Learning Plan? This is why. Those answers form the core of your intrinsic motivation. Remember your reasons, and frequently ask whether what you're currently doing is in service of those objectives, and not simply playing someone else's game.

So again, beware gamification. It's fun and easy, but it can limit your growth.
