# 4-5: Research

No matter what instructional materials you discover, they will be incomplete. At some point, you need to venture out on your own for deeper understanding of a topic. Performing research is one of the most critical skills of the self-directed learner. And unfortunately, it's never been more difficult to do well.

Search engines are returning less helpful results. Many older, reliable sources of information are going offline due to cost. And to top it off, generative models are producing authoritative sounding nonsense at a rate too rapid to process. It's tough out there for a learner looking for quality information.

As a K-12 technology educator, I made sure my students had ample training on **media literacy**—the skills necessary to evaluate information provided to you. Important concepts in this realm include:

- Understanding the nature of facts
- Understanding information provenance
- Identifying and considering biases
- Recognizing rhetorical devices and logical fallacies
- Finding corroborating sources
- Seeking primary sources

You may have a solid foundation here—or you may think you do. An entire Media Literacy curriculum is outside the scope of this course, but I would provide you a few guiding questions whenever evaluating a new source of information.

## Searching

### General Search Tips

Let's get the basics out of the way: do not use Google unless you have to. Google search results have been getting worse for years, but 2023-2024 has seen a massive decline in search result quality. Ads, SEO-gaming sites just looking to serve you more ads, and officially-generated "AI" nonsense have made it much more difficult to access real information. This is especially true for serious study. We're not interested in a Reddit post about the best dishwashers; we need authoritative information on our area of study.

Instead, for general search, consider using less advertisement-ridden options like [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) or [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org). While they do rely on other indexes like Bing, they are not pushing promoted material.

When you write your search prompts, make sure to take advantage of the complete search syntax available. Use quotes around terms for exact matches. You can also specify things like `inurl:.edu` to only receive results from `.edu` websites. [Here](https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/results/syntax/) is DuckDuckGo's full syntax guide. 

As the information you seek gets more and more academic, you may find that adding `filetype:pdf` makes your results much more useful. Peer-reviewed material is published as PDF; that's how that goes.

### Beyond General Search

It's entirely possible that you will find yourself in need of more specialized searches or databases than the likes of Google or DuckDuckGo can offer. You may require access to expensive private databases like Lexis Nexis or JSTOR. You may find that books you need are hard to come by. In those situations, you can turn to an invaluable service that exists to connect you to vast amounts of information across media types:

Your public library. 

> **Warning:** this advice may not apply to your country of residence. I am unaware of the public library situation in most of the world, and can only speak from my experience.

In the United States, public libraries have been denigrated, underfunded, overburdened, and generally abused for decades—just like every other useful public service. Nevertheless, they still provide critical free access to information of all kinds. Did you know you can borrow textbooks? What about videos? Software? It's all true. Libraries also maintain subscriptions to many private databases, allowing you to search them as well via your library membership. And if there's a resource the local library doesn't have, it's very possible they can obtain it for you through the magic of **interlibrary loan**. I could go on. Basically, if you can, get a library card and use it to its fullest extent.
## Evaluating

Once you have the information in hand, you still need to answer some questions to assess its value. Not all sources are created equal. Make sure you know the naswers to the following:

1. Who created this?
2. Is the creator a recognized authority on the material? Says who?
3. What biases are present in the material?
4. Does this agree with other sources I've found?
5. Are claims backed up with evidence? Is the evidence cited?

You need these answers in order to determine the value of the information, and how to fit in into your learning. But now, I'm going to give you a secret hack for understanding most any topic more deeply than most. All you need to do is find the originating information.

### Primary Sources

Sources created by those involved in any subject are worth your time and attention. They might not be the most academic, but the raw information can't be beat. This is as true for reading authors' take on their won work (Sup Poe's "Philosophy of Composition") or the RFC for a network protocol. Take the hard time. Read the primary sources.

## The Scourge of AI

I'll keep this brief since I already went off in the last chapter, but the corollary of the first question I asked above is "Did someone create this at all?" It's getting harder and harder to identify model-generated material—at least without context. Even academic research is not immune to this plague. Let me be perfectly clear: **model-generated material is not trustworthy**. As a learner, you are not equipped to identify the subtle errors that could be present in text generated by a language model. Are humans imperfect? Of course. But with a source that answers the questions above, you can verify claims much more readily. There is a consistency of intent and, in the best sources, an unwillingness to make claims without experience. Language models have no such scruples. Avoid at all costs.
