# Acknowledgments 

This course would not have been possible without the support of the Taggart Institute community, especially the volunteer Faculty who review our courses. I am forever in your debt, my dear friends, for all the work you've done to build this little school of ours.

Profound gratitude to my wife Jâ€”, for her patience and ceaseless support. Thank you for enduring months of complaining about writer's block on this thing.

Lastly, I dedicate this course to my late mother, Carol Taggart. Mom, you were the best teacher I ever had, and taught me not only how to teach, but how to love learning. I'll try to carry on the family business.
