# Epilogue

I have down my very best to give you all the tools and wisdom I've accrued over a career of teaching and learning. I hope you feel better equipped to set out on your learning journey with these in hand. If you'll permit me a moment's more philosophy...

The human ability to learn, grow, and better oneself is unique in the universe, at least as far as we know. Other creatures can learn, certainly, but only humans can find meaning in knowledge and use it to reshape their understanding of themselves and their world. This capacity is a sacred thing to me. Seeking knowledge makes us more human. It is my deepest wish that you find the joy in the journey that I've found. 

I'll see you on the road.
