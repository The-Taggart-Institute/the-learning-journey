# The Learning Journey

Do you want to learn something outside of a traditional classroom setting? Do have questions about how to do it well, how to do it successfully? Are you crazy busy with other obligations, and have no idea how you'll make it all work?

You're in the right place.

I've been teaching students of all ages for the better part of 20 years now, both in classrooms and remotely. I've been a self-directed learner for longer than that. Combining these histories, I've put together a set of tools, a little education theory, and some simple methods for success in self-directed learning. With these, I hope you'll find success and fulfillment in the journey.
